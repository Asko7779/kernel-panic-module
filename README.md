a simple, experimental kernel panic module written in C++. Built for my OS projects, learning, and kinda just out of boredom

---

## What is This?

This project is an early, barebones attempt at handling kernel panics

## Why Did I Make This?

I started this module as a way to dive deeper into how operating systems deal with catastrophic failures. Theres a lot to learn from seeing things break sometimes

## What Makes It Interesting?

- **Pure C++:** 100% C++. No weird dependencies.
- **Hackable & Simple:** The code is intentionally straightforward so you can mess with it, break it, or build on top
- **Learning-Focused:** It’s not production-ready, but its a great place to get your hands dirty if you’re curious about OS internals
- **Open for Suggestions:** If you have ideas, spot issues, or want to collaborate, Id love to hear from you
